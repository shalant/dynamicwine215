## Special Gotchas of your projects (Problems you faced, unique elements of your project)
### Coding google maps, filters, CRUD operations, UI/UX, deploying to Heroku, mastering >100 Github commits, and  Passport.js authentication were each personal mountains. The group had to restart two separate times. On the bright side, each failure WAS accompanied by learning.

## Technical Description of your project like- Installation, Setup, How to contribute.
### From the command line, type "git clone https://github.com/carolinetwyman/dynamicwine.git". Then type "npm install," and "npm start."

### To add wines, you have 3 options: 1) use our dummy list by typing "npm run seed." 2) Alternatively, you can manually enter a wine list into scripts/seedDB.js followed by "npm run seed." 3) Or enter them through the website, using the winefinder and clicking submit for each wine.
